CACHED_RESPONSE = "Title:\nPipetting Technique for Serial Dilution Using P200 and P2 Pipettes\n\nObjective:\nTo demonstrate accurate pipetting skills using P200 and P2 micropipettes for transferring and mixing liquids between wells in a microplate.\n\nMaterials:\n1. P200 micropipette, adjustable volume range from 20 to 200 microlitres\n2. P2 micropipette, adjustable volume range from 0.2 to 2 microlitres\n3. Sterile pipette tips compatible with P200 and P2 pipettes\n4. Microplate (96-well plate, U-shaped wells, standard size, clear color)\n5. Waste container for tip disposal\n\nProcedure:\n1. Setting up the Workspace:\n   a. Organize the microplate, pipettes, tips, and waste container on a clean, flat surface.\n   b. Ensure that the P200 and P2 pipettes are calibrated and set to the correct volumes before use.\n\n2. Pipetting with P200:\n   a. Set the P200 pipette to 25 microlitres.\n   b. Attach a new, sterile pipette tip by pressing the P200 pipette into the tip box.\n   c. Pick up the P200 pipette, depress the plunger to the first stop, and immerse the tip into the liquid in well A1.\n   d. Slowly release the plunger to aspirate 25 microlitres of liquid.\n   e. Move to well A9, touch the side of the well with the pipette tip, and dispense the liquid by pressing the plunger to the second stop.\n   f. Withdraw the pipette while still pressing the plunger, and then release to avoid aspirating liquid back into the tip.\n   g. Discard the used tip into the waste container.\n\n3. Pipetting with P2:\n   a. Set the P2 pipette to 1 microlitre.\n   b. Repeat steps 2.b through 2.g for the P2 pipette, aspirating and dispensing 1 microlitre of liquid from well A3 into A9.\n   c. Change the tip and repeat for transferring 1 microlitre from well A5 to A9.\n\n4. Mixing with P200:\n   a. Attach a new tip to the P200 pipette.\n   b. Set the pipette to 200 microlitres (the maximum volume if not previously specified) to facilitate mixing through a larger volume if needed.\n   c. Immerse the tip into the mixed liquids in well A9 and pipette up and down at least three times to mix thoroughly.\n   d. Discard the tip into the waste container.\n\nNotes:\n- Ensure that each step is carried out with a new, sterile tip to avoid cross-contamination.\n- Maintain a consistent technique while aspirating and dispensing to ensure accuracy and repeatability.\n- Adjust the pipetting technique based on the viscosity and other properties of the liquid being pipetted if necessary.\n- Before starting the experiment, practice with water to ensure the accuracy of the pipetting technique.\n- Verify the functionality and calibration of the micropipettes periodically according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n\nManufacturer and catalog number for materials (brand and catalog number may vary based on availability and institutional preference):\n- P200 micropipette: BrandTech Scientific (Cat.
